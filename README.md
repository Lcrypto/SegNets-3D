# SegNets- 2D/3D Deep Neural Network Using Stack of Super Resolution Deep Neural Network and GANs: cycleGAN, SRGAN, ESRGAN  

Rewritten by me project from original https://github.com/yingDaWang-UNSW/SegNets-3D for doing end-to-end Train and Inference 2D/3D images Super resolution and Segmentation using SRCNN Resnet and SRGANs: ESRGAN, SRGAN, WDSRGAN. For detail read Wang Ying Da PH.D THESIS Machine Learning Methods and Computationally Efficient Techniques in Digital Rock Analysis, 2020 and all related articles.
